## Questions

1. What problem does using exports solve?

- Allows code to be used between files, while only having to reference one script tag in the html file.

2. How does export differ from export default?

- Export refers to a specific value, e.g. a variable. Export default exports the variable itself, allowing the value to be changed.

3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?

- Code can be split into smaller files of self-contained functionality.

Multiple scripts can be concatenated thereby increasing performance.

Debugging becomes easier.

Any code referencing a module understands it is a dependency. If the module file is changed or moved, the problem is immediately obvious.
