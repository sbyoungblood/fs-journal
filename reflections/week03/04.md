2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

- Subscribe, unsubscribe, broadcast

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

- I genuinely don't feel comfortable with my knowledge base of either of these tools to be able to answer this. That said, I am incredibly grateful for the bcw template.
