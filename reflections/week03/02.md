## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

- The grouping of like concerns. I also serves as a way to restrict the direct access to some components of an object, so users cannot access state values for all of the variables of a particular object.

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

- With the underscore, these often refer to methods that they do not intend users of the API to call directly.

Not sure about closures.

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

- By placing them inside of a factory or constructor function. This makes them inaccessible outside of that scope.
