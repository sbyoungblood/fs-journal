## Questions

1. In your own words, why do we use Git?

- In addition to allowing multiple developers to work in tandem on a project, Git also stores a history of changes made in the code, and allows developers to revert to previous versions.

2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

- Branches allow us to commit code that may differ from the master branch, as well as merge code back together. For example, two developers can test different code using different branches, find what works, and merge that code.

3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub

- Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes and move code between local and remote repositories. GitHub is a remote repository on the internet.
