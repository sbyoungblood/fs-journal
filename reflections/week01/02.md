## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

- A pseudo class is an element that is in a specific state, such as a link being hovered or clicked by the cursor. Common examples might include hover, visited, before, and after.

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

- Specificity determines what css styles override others in the code. Element selectors hav a spec of 001, class selectors have a spec of 010, and ID selectors have a spec of 100. These values are combined to determine specificity. We can use this to apply style to certain elements only at certain times.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

- !important is silly and should basically never be used. It overrides all other specificity and outweighs any other styles, even ID selectors, which are often (I imagine) used for high specificity.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

CSS by itself (without bootstrap) can be quite confusing. Colors, sizing, fonts etc are fairly straight forward, but positioning (margin, padding) can be a nightmare.
