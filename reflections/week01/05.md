# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

- Basics of HTML and CSS. Bootstrap grid system.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

- Nothing was terribly shocking, but the pace of the cohort is definitely a lot to handle.

- What are you struggling with?

- Organizing code. My code seems to do the job, mostly, but seems cluttered, and perhaps often unecessary.

- What would you count as a victory?

- My duck won in the classroom timer race, lol.
