## Questions

1. What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?

- Pair Programming is when two developers share a workstation (one computer). The 'driver' sits at the computer and inputs code, while the other partner, the 'navigator', is in charge of the overall direction.

2. What are some benefits of Pair Programming?

- Code quality increases, the knowledge is diffused amongst the entire team, less experienced developers can pick up invaluable skills from those with more experience, and increased resiliency to interruptions/distractions.

3. What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?

- While the overhead cost of pair programming is often greater than that of programming individually, those costs are often regained through the quality of the product (finished code).
