# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

- My timeboxing went fairly well. I did really well building out the backend.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

- Not so much of a surprise, as I found this out in Hackathon, but to see first hand how much more work the front end took was rather shocking to me.

- What are you struggling with?

- Reactivity

- What would you count as a victory?

- Going in to the turn around due date, I'm looking at a 19 out of 19, as far as I can tell.
