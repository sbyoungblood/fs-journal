## Questions

1. What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?

- UX, or user experience, is every interaction your business has with people on your website, mobile site, apps, and online properties or services. The biggest consideration when creating a good UX is allowing the customer to do what THEY want to do (within reason I suppose).

2. What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience? 

- Taking into account whether or not something is confusing, or cold and uncaring, etc., will lead to creating an app or product that makes the customer feel good.

3. Why is the User Experience important?

- When a customer feels good using your, say, website, they are more likely to stick around, click a call-to-action, or even share the site.
