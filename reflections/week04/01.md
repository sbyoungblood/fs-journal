> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?

- A pyramid shape, and '})' at the end of lines of code are good signifiers of callback hell. This is often caused when people try to write JavaScript in a way where execution happens visually from top to bottom.

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?

- Async means something will take time- that it will not happen immediately. After async code runs, other code is 'called back' to run.

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`

- Keep code shallow
  -name functions
- Modularize
  -write small modules that each do one thing, and assemble them into other modules that do a larger thing.
- Handle every error
  -node.js style where the first argument to the callback is always reserved for an error.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

- I can see why async code can get quickly convoluted, but modularizing makes a lot of sense as the best tool in my toolkit so far.
