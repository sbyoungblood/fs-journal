## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?

- Timeboxing is a time management technique that involves assigning fixed units of time to an activity or task in advance and then completing that activity or task during the designated time frame.

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

- The two minute rule: I'm often overwhelmed by the simplest of tasks. Being realistic about the time each my take will allow me to finish things that, in reality, require almost no time whatsoever.

- My inbox is not my action list: I create a separate action list. This is my go to. My inbox merely feeds input into the overall action list.

- Practice and adapt: Timeboxing likely won't be second nature when I begin. Best to calibrate, and keep reworking it till it works for me.

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 

- I have yet to really apply timeboxing before. I may have attempted such principles with homework back in the day, but hardly ever stuck to it with any sense of rigor. I look forward to putting these practices to actual use.
