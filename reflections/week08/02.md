## Questions

1. Why is communication on a small team important?

- Communication for a team of any size is paramount. Team members must be made clear of goals, standards, and expectations regarding the project.

2. What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?

- With potentially more responsibility divided up amongst a smaller team, there may be less time available to devote to meetings. So dialing in the communication flow from client to developers is key to maintaining efficiency and quality.

3. What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?

- The unattainable triangle is essentially a paradox regarding the speed, cost, and quality of a delivered product. Good, Fast, Cheap. You can have any two, but only two.
