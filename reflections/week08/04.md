## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

- Unit tests allow you to test individual units of code in isolation. The purpose of unit testing is to provide developers with confidence in their code.
- Component testing frameworks were created to give users the ability to do test components in a reliable way while also providing Vue-specific conveniences such as integrations for Vuex, Vue Router, and other Vue plugins.
- End-to-End (E2E) tests provide coverage on what is arguably the most important aspect of an application: what happens when users actually use your applications.

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

- E2E testing is arguably most useful, as it is the most definitive example of what its like to actually USE a product.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

- Component testing is fairly niche, the results of which can likely be covered, albeit less efficiently, through unit testing.
