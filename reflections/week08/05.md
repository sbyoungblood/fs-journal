# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

- We managed to wrangle a very difficult API into our app.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

- Our original pitch was, in my thinking, our Ideal version of our app. We were quickly told that it was hardly an MVP.

- What are you struggling with?

- Knowledge gaps in the back end. We haven't done a great job of keeping all members up to date on all aspects of the code.

- What would you count as a victory?

- Our team is functioning well together, and working with a lot of support and respect.
