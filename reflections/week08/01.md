## Questions

1. What function does a developer Portfolio provide?

- A developer portfolio aids in showcasing skill sets and proficiencies.

2. What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?

- Simplicity, showing off only the best projects. Quality over quantity

3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?

- While I don't have projects of my own built out yet that I would like to showcase, I'm hoping the capstone will be portfolio worthy. In addition, I plan to build things for family and friends, as well as a couple local businesses that I'd like to use as well.
