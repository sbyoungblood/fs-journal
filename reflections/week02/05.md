# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

- I'm incredibly proud of my checkpoint.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

- That functions are not as rigidly structured as I had thought. That given certain boundaries, they can really be whatever I need them to be.

- What are you struggling with?

- Parameters, arguments, for/for each loops.

- What would you count as a victory?

- Warehouse manager, ice cream parlor, and my checkpoint.
