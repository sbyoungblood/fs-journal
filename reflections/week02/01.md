## Questions

1. What is Scope ? 

- Scope describes where variables are available for use.
 Globally scoped, function scoped, block scoped.

2. What is Hoisting ?

- A JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

- var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not re-declared; const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared. Also, they are all hoisted to the top of their scope but while var variables are initialized with undefined, let and const variables are not initialized.
