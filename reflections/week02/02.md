## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

- A function declaration, a function expression(s?), and and arrow function expression. Arrow is just a shorter syntax for function expressions, and doesn't create it's own 'this' value. Function expressions are not hoisted, and cannot be used before being defined.

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

- Parameters are used when defining a function, they are the names created in the function definition. Arguments, on the other hand, are the values the function receives from each parameter when the function is executed (invoked).

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

- When a function accepts another function as a parameter, or returns a function. Array.prototype.map and Array.prototype.filter are higher order functions (I am unfamiliar with these examples so far).
