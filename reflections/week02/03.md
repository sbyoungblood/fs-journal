## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

- Based on the reading, I'm not sure. Perhaps I don't understand the question. I'm familiar with console.log in my own code, and invoking functions from the console, but otherwise I'm not quite certain about the 'main' ways to write info to the console.

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

- The Elements tab. This tab allows me to see and manipulate the code and the DOM simultaneously. Hovering over any line of HTML will highlight the element on the DOM, and vice versa.

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

- Although I am not familiar with this yet myself, I believe the answer would be to use the debugging pane on the sources tab.
