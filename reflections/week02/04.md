## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

- Going in with a plan keeps me focused, makes my time used efficiently, allows me to do research which may snuff out problems before they even arise, and may keep my code from becoming too bloated because I'm just writing blindly with no direction.

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

- Google Google Google.

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

- I don't test enough. Even when I thought I was testing enough, I wasn't testing enough. I need to test smaller and more often.
